My name is Ana, I'm a creative and curious person that loves to understand how and why things work the way they do. I'm also a Biologist with a Master's degree in Environmental Microbiology starting to explore the world of Web Development. 

- 🎯 Currently I'm learning Web Development with JavaScript, HTML and CSS on a Fullstack program provided by Alura platform.
- 🐍 I have a basic knowledge of Python, R, SQL from Google Data Analytics Certificate that I'm finishing, and It is my intention to delve deeper into these topics as well. 
- 🎲 I'm might be addicted to research and data so I'll probably ask you for some references :P
- 🎨 I've always been surrounded by art in my family and I try to incorporate it into everything I do.
