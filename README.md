# Hi there! 

Good to see you here :) Do you want a cup of coffee? ☕

My name is Ana, I'm a creative and curious person that loves to understand how and why things work the way they do. I'm also a Biologist with a Master's degree in Environmental Microbiology starting to explore the world of programming and data analysis.

- 🎯Currently I'm learning and practicing mostly JavaScript, HTML and CSS on a Fullstack program provided by Alura platform
- 🐍 I'm also familiar with Python, R and SQL, and since I'm most likely going to follow the data, Python will be my priority after I finish my Fullstack program
- 🎲 I'm might be addicted to research  and data so I'll probably ask you for some references :P
- 🎨 After my studies in Biology I've spent some time doing art and I'm always trying to incorporate it in my life
