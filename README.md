My name is Ana, I'm a creative and curious person that loves to understand how and why things work the way they do. I'm also a Biologist with a Master's degree in Environmental Microbiology starting to explore the world of web development and data analysis.

- 🎯 Currently I'm learning web development with JavaScript, HTML and CSS on a Fullstack program provided by Alura platform.
- 🐍 I have a basic knowledge of Python, R and SQL and data analysis and It is my intention to delve deeper into these topics as well. 
- 🎲 I'm might be addicted to research and data so I'll probably ask you for some references :P
- 🎨 After my studies in Biology I've spent some time doing art and I'm always trying to incorporate it in my life
