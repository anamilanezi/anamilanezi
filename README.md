My name is Ana, I'm a creative and curious person that loves to understand how and why things work the way they do. I'm also a Biologist with a Master's degree in Environmental Microbiology and since the beginning of 2022 I've started to explore the world of Web Development and data analysis.

- 🐍 I'm currently delving into Python with Dr. Angela Yu in the 100 days of code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. You can check my projects and development [here](https://github.com/anamilanezi/py-practices). 
- 🎯 I have a Front-end Certification from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) which covered HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, responsive layouts and related topics.
